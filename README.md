# Cipher-City
Cipher city is a python implementation of different ciphers learned in my MTH-328 Codes &amp; Ciphers class at Muhlenberg College.
There are built in python function that would have helped me during the creation of this, but I wanted to challenge myself to do it using modular arithmetic used in class and ASCII values. As of right now, there is a working encrypt and decrypt for the shift cipher, affine cipher, and the Vigenere cipher.
